Mars-base

One of the first videogames I tried to make, provably won't work at all because it has too many bugs (it was one of the first big projects I did. I started it the first year I learned C.

Imported from the now defunct googlecode.

Also, even the email in the headers are wrong, nake90@terra.es doesn't exist anymore so if you need anything contact me using github or my webpage http://www.nakerium.com/

I might continue it, and sometimes I use part of the code for other projects so I decided to keep it here. It felt kind of sad to delete something I loved programming so much ;)

My programming skills have improved quite a lot since so please bear with this project...

Intento de videojuego que hice hace mucho tiempo, seguramente no funcione casi nada por muchos bugs (es uno de los primeros proyectos grandes que hice. Lo empecé el primer año que aprendí C.
